A common example of this is making a request: no matter how fast your internet is, any network request is not going to be instant.</p> <p>Modern JavaScript has a cool utility for dealing with these: Promises. These are how your block can inform Scratch that your block is waiting for an async operation to complete, and the eventual value.</p> <p>{require('!raw-loader!@site/static/example-extensions/async.js')}</p> <p>Notice the async blocks are defined the same as other blocks in getInfo(). The only difference is the return value of the function.</p> <p>The first block in this question is roughly equivalent to Scratch's built-in wait block. Notice that we had to manually construct a Promise this time because setTimeout does not use Promises. When Scratch hits this block, it won't continue executing the script until this promise resolves. Scratch may continue executing other scripts in the meantime. Wait is a command block (no return value), so it shouldn't resolve with anything (it would be ignored).</p> <p>The second block is a block that tries to fetch a URL, similar to the \"Fetch\" extension on https://extensions.turbowarp.org/. fetch() already returns a promise, so we simply chain on top of it instead of making a new promise this time.</p> <p>The restriction on return values still applies: you still need to ensure that you return a string, number, or boolean, so we call text() in then() to convert the Response object from fetch() into a string.</p> <p>This also demonstrates error handling. Whenever your promises can reject, fail, or error, you should add a catch(). How exactly you handle this will depend on your use case, but often you will want to log the error to the console and return a string indicating the error.</p>"},{"location":"development/extensions/async/#exercises","title":"Exercises","text":"<ol> <li>Create a block that waits 100ms for each time it's been called.

Each property you put in <code>arguments</code> corresponds to a single argument. Each one has a name. The names can be all capitals or any format you desire.</p> <p>Here's a summary of the most common properties to set for an argument:</p> Type Description type Scratch.ArgumentType.* Determines the shape of the input and what values the default text input accepts. Most commonly Scratch.ArgumentType.STRING, Scratch.ArgumentType.NUMBER, or Scratch.ArgumentType.BOOLEAN. See the table below for acceptable values. Note that this is only a suggestion and the real type may vary. defaultValue string Optional. The default value in the toolbox. Only use this for inputs with a text box; not for boolean inputs. menu string Discussed later. <p>These are the acceptible values for type:</p> Description Example Scratch.ArgumentType.STRING Any text apple, 123, true Scratch.ArgumentType.NUMBER Any number 123 Scratch.ArgumentType.BOOLEAN True or false. This one is special as it tries to prevent users from dropping non-booleans into the input. true Scratch.ArgumentType.COLOR A hex color code #ff4c4c Scratch.ArgumentType.ANGLE A direction input. 90 means to the right. Increases counterclockwise. Same as sprite direction. 90, 180 Scratch.ArgumentType.MATRIX A 5x5 matrix represented in binary 11101010101... Scratch.ArgumentType.NOTE A note on a piano keyboard. ? Scratch.ArgumentType.IMAGE Displays an inline image, not actually an input. Described later. N/A Scratch.ArgumentType.COSTUME Names of costumes within that sprite. costume1 Scratch.ArgumentType.SOUND Names of sounds within that sprite. recording1 <p>Next, Scratch needs to know where to put each of the arguments in the block. Are they at the start, end, or somewhere in the middle? It can't guess, so you have to tell it. To do this, you use the <code>text</code> property on the block by using <code>[ARGUMENT_NAME]</code> syntax to denote where each input goes. Each argument in the <code>arguments</code> object should appear in <code>text</code> exactly once. Arguments can be in any order; it doesn't matter.</p> <p>When Scratch runs your block functions, it will pass in an object for the first value. This object will contain a value for each argument name that the block has. Conventionally we call this <code>args</code> or use destructuring syntax. As an example, if the block has an argument named <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code>, these could be accessed in any of these ways:</p> <pre><code>  // Using args.XYZ format...\n  goto(args) {\n    console.log(args.X, args.Y);\n  }\n\n  // Or using destructuring...\n  goto({X, Y}) {\n    console.log(X, Y);\n  }\n</code></pre> <p>Arguments can be a string, number, or boolean regardless of the type specified as the argument's <code>type</code>.

You almost always want this to be <code>true</code>. <p>A field is an argument that can only be set to a fixed string. As an example, see the input in the \"stop all\" block.

Almost every menu you use should explicitly set <code>acceptReporters</code> to true so that it is an \"input\" instead of a \"field\". The only exception to this rule is when using event-based hat blocks, which will be discussed much later.
